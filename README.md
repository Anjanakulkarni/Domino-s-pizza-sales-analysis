This project's goal is to analyze Domino's Pizza sales data, focusing on branch 
performance, product popularity, and sales target effectiveness. We collect, 
clean, and structure sales data, creating interactive visualizations using Power BI. 
We assess branch performance, identify top locations, analyze product 
popularity, and evaluate sales targets. Customer segmentation, time series 
analysis, and geospatial insights are also part of the project. Our objective is to 
provide actionable recommendations for improving sales and profitability. 
Security measures protect sensitive data, and findings are shared with 
stakeholders via reports and presentations.
